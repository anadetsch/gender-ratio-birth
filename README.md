## Project Description

The sex ratio at birth is bilogicaly male skewed, but I was surprise when I discovered that for some countries the numbers are way higher than biology can explain. 
The normal ratio should be 105 boys per 100 girls. The global average of 107 is already above this number, but still inside, or better saying, exactly the acceptable including the possible variance.
Both most populous countries in the world have a way higher number, 115 in China and 110 India.
The difference between the expected female birth and the real number combined with the infanticide of girls result in what is called ‘missing women’. The estimation is that in 2015 we had more than 136 million missing women worldwide. To put this number into perspective we can compare it with the population of Mexico (that is 128million). China and India are responsible for 83% of this number. 
The sex ratio at birth can be compared with the spread of ultrasonography machines, that gives the possibility of knowing in advance the sex of the baby. 
After the 70s sex-selective abortion become popular, at the same time that ultrasonography machine start to spread worldwide. 
Although India is just the 5th country here, the biggest players are still China and India. According to the Proceeding of National Academy of Science, booths countries combined are responsible for more than 90% of the total world-wide sex-selective abortions.


## Questions & Hypotheses

- Why some countries have a higher male biased ratio?
- Is there any economical influence or is it a cultural preference for a male child?
- What are the consequences?


## Dataset

### 1.1. Database
The data was from the website Our World in Data.
- source of data:
    - source: https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio
   
     
### 1.2. Web scraping
- Web scraping to create a list of country names.

## Workflow

1. Brainstorming and Alignement on topics and possible questions
2. Research of relevant data 
3. Comparing data sources and decision which data sources to use
4. Extracting and cleaning the data
4. Merging the data
5. Data Analysis
6. Data visualization 
7. Preparing the Presentation 


## Organization

The project was organized by using a trello-board and assigning to-dos and deadlines.
